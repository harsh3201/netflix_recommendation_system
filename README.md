## Home Page
Here, the user can choose a list of their favourite movies and series and their preferred language. For example, I have entered a list with 2 Horror Movies(Insidious and Insidious Chapter 2), an action series(Supergirl), and a drama series(Suits) as my list of choices, and English and Hindi as my preferred languages.
Clicking on the Get Started button, the user will see the list of recommendations.
